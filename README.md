# weekly-menu

A simple program to automate weekly meal planning.

## What It Does

- Get list of recipes from a Google Sheet.
- Leave one week in between before repeating the other recipes.
- Easily configure days for easy, medium, or difficult meals to account for days we are short in time ( kids events, in the office, etc ).
- Skip Fridays, because that's our night to eat out. Make this configurable.
- Schedule an event in my Google Calendar and invite my wife.
- Run weekly on Friday so that we can purchase groceries on Saturday.
